# The Day Before Tomorrow

## Investigating AMOC variability in ECCOv4r5

Provide a brief introduction describing the proposed work. Be sure to also decribe what skills team members will get to learn and practice as part of this project.

### Collaborators

| Name | Personal goals | Can help with | Role |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Clark Z | I want to learn about the ECCO tools, using GitHub, and improve my Python skills | I can help with understanding the science behind AMOC | Project Lead |
| Yifei F | I want to learn what state estimate is and all potential applications of ECCO | I can help with Python and provide atmospheric science perspective | Project Lead |
| Tanvir S | I want to learn about ECCO State estimate and EMU tools | I can help with adjoint based sensitivity analysis of AMOC | Project Lead |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### The problem
 
What controls MHT and AMOC variability over the past 3 decades?

## Data and Methods

### Data
ECCOv4r5. 

### Existing methods

Traditionally this is done with statistical techniques, linear inverse models, analyzing global climate models, and/or general circulation models

### Proposed methods/tools

We will use the EMU Adjoint gradient tool, attribution tool, and convolution tool.
We will also develop a python scirpt that allows us to easily calculate the AMOC in density space

### Additional resources or background reading

Optional: links to manuscripts or technical documents providing background information, context, or other relevant information.

## Project goals and tasks

### Project goals

List the specific project goals or research questions you want to answer. Think about what outcomes or deliverables you'd like to create (e.g. a series of tutorial notebooks demonstrating how to work with a dataset, results of an anaysis to answer a science question, an example of applying a new analysis method, or a new python package).

* Calculate MOC in density coordinates
* Goal 2
* ...

### Tasks

What are the individual tasks or steps that need to be taken to achieve each of the project goals identified above? What are the skills that participants will need or will learn and practice to complete each of these tasks? Think about which tasks are dependent on prior tasks, or which tasks can be performed in parallel.

* Task 1 (all team members will learn to use GitHub)
* Task 2 (C)
  * Task 2a (assigned to team member A)
  * Task 2b (assigned to team member B)
* Task 3
* ...

## Project Results

Use this section to briefly summarize your project results. This could take the form of describing the progress your team made to answering a research question, developing a tool or tutorial, interesting things found in exploring a new dataset, lessons learned for applying a new method, personal accomplishments of each team member, or anything else the team wants to share.

You could include figures or images here, links to notebooks or code elsewhere in the repository (such as in the [notebooks](notebooks/) folder), and information on how others can run your notebooks or code.
